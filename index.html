                                        order to tackle the counterfeiting industry, I've decided to
                                        build on the idea of certi-chain and create a potential
                                        startup which might be pitched to the school. The market for
                                        counterfeited item is huge and they're a lot of illegal
                                        companies, illegally producing fake goods. Also, theft of a
                                        personal belonging is quite common and the prevention of
                                        theft doesn't really exist.

                                        Here secure tags promises to prevent the cloning of goods by
                                        legit companies by placing NFC tags on products and also
                                        attach a name to the product. The owner's name will be
                                        attached on every NFC tags which will prevent theft. We plan
                                        to expand the idea by attaching NFT into each tag and making
                                        smart contracts which will be placed on the ethereum
                                        blockchain.

                                        to help the economy by creating a solution which help
                                        authenticate product and reduce the number of fake goods in
                                        the world.

                                        Certi-Chain uses a python based blockchain to authenticate
                                        any products with a Certi-Chain NFC tag. Each tag will
                                        contain a unique ID attached to the blockchain that cannot
                                        be faked. Users are able to tap their phones on any product
                                        containing a Certi-Chain tag to view the authenticity of a
                                        product through the Certi-Chain blockchain. Additionally if
                                        the product is authentic users are also able to see where
                                        the products materials were sourced and assembled.

                                        During a hackathon (HooHacks 2021), me and my friends
                                        decided to take a step toward environmental change by
                                        created a form of cryptocurrency which differentiates itself
                                        from others by using less energy. We've looked at the
                                        current trend of crypto such as Bitcoin and many more which
                                        relies on many computers computing hashes on a blockchain
                                        which solely relies on the pure computer power generating
                                        tons of waste energy. Our team came up with a solution to
                                        solve this by creating a cryptocurrency that relies on one's
                                        environmental footprint and luck.

                                        project, EcoBlock uses a Proof of Stake system which is a
                                        "lottery" type system to distribute its currency. This
                                        ideology is different from Bitcoin because Bitcoin relies on
                                        a Proof of Work system which relies on the computing power
                                        of a computer, thus creating waste energy. Therefore, we've
                                        created a way to distribute our currency to others by a
                                        "lottery" system which also factors one's environmental
                                        impacts as a way to increase their odds.

                                        During a hackathon (nwHacks 2021), our team decided to
                                        tackle a current day situation, which was the Corona Virus
                                        Epidemic. In order to prevent the spread of COVID, we've
                                        decided to help others by creating a solution to help the
                                        improve the process of the government's rollout of COVID
                                        vaccines.
                                    </p>

                                        <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Project Idea:</span> Our
                                        project, was to create a platform which individual answers a
                                        series of questions to determine who has first priority on
                                        receiving the COVID vaccine. We've done this through a
                                        decision-based algorithm which is done on the backend to
                                        determine who has first priority and transfer than
                                        information to the frontend for clinics to see.

                                        <span class="has-text-weight-bold">My Task:</span> I worked
                                        as a full-stack developer creating the web-application using
                                        HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also work on fixing the
                                        communication between the clients and server side.
