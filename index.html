                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Project Goal:</span> During a hackathon (HooHacks 2021), me and my friends decided to 
                    take a step toward environmental change by created a form of cryptocurrency which differentiates 
                    itself from others by using less energy. We've looked at the current trend of crypto such as 
                    Bitcoin and many more which relies on many computers computing hashes on a blockchain which solely relies 
                    on the pure computer power generating tons of waste energy. Our team came up with a solution to solve this by 
                    creating a cryptocurrency that relies on one's environmental footprint and luck.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Project Idea:</span> Our project, EcoBlock uses a Proof of Stake system which is a 
                    "lottery" type system to distribute its currency. This ideology is different from Bitcoin because Bitcoin relies on a Proof of Work 
                    system which relies on the computing power of a computer, thus creating waste energy. Therefore, we've created a way to distribute 
                    our currency to others by a "lottery" system which also factors one's environmental impacts as a way to increase their odds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">My Task:</span> I worked as full-stack creating endpoints for EcoBlock. I consolidated the Front-end Flutter application with the Backend blockchain using Firebase BaaS.

                    the Corona Virus Epidemic. In order to prevent the spread of COVID, we've decided to help others by creating a solution to 
                    help the improve the process of the government's rollout of COVID vaccines.

                  <p>
                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Project Idea:</span> Our project, was to create a platform which individual answers a series of 
                    questions to determine who has first priority on receiving the COVID vaccine. We've done this through a decision-based algorithm which 
                    is done on the backend to determine who has first priority and transfer than information to the frontend for clinics to see.

                    the economy by creating a solution which help authenticate product and reduce the number of fake goods in the world. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Project Idea:</span> Certi-Chain uses a python based blockchain to authenticate any products with a Certi-Chain NFC tag. Each tag will contain a unique ID attached to the blockchain that cannot be faked. Users are able to tap their phones on any product containing a Certi-Chain tag to view the authenticity of a product through the Certi-Chain blockchain. Additionally if the product is authentic users are also able to see where the products materials were sourced and assembled.
